Airfoil is a versatile and user-friendly application designed to enhance your audio experience by allowing you to stream sound from your computer to multiple speakers and devices simultaneously. Unlike standard streaming solutions that restrict you to specific apps, Airfoil captures audio from any source—be it a web browser, media player, or professional DAW—and sends it to AirPlay receivers, Google Cast devices, Bluetooth speakers, and more.

This capability makes Airfoil an essential tool for anyone looking to create a unified audio environment across different rooms or setups. You can control volume levels individually, group devices for synchronized playback, and even stream to other computers running Airfoil Satellite. The software maintains high audio fidelity and minimal delay, ensuring a seamless listening experience whether you're hosting an event, giving a presentation, or simply enjoying music at home.

Airfoil is built for modern macOS systems, including full compatibility with Apple Silicon processors. Its clean and accessible interface allows quick setup and management, while powerful behind-the-scenes options cater to advanced users. With robust support for a wide array of audio hardware and software, Airfoil stands out as a reliable and flexible choice for multi-output audio streaming.
